IMPORTANT: GitHub Actions Setup Required
=========================================

To make the admin panel PR submissions work, you need to add a Personal Access Token (PAT) to your repository secrets.

STEP 1: Add PAT to Repository Secrets
--------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/danieledge/Fogh-timeline/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: PAT_TIMELINE_BOT
4. Value: [Your PAT with repo and workflow scopes]
5. Click "Add secret"

STEP 2: Enable Workflow Permissions (if needed)
------------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/danieledge/Fogh-timeline/settings/actions
2. Scroll to "Workflow permissions"
3. Select: "Read and write permissions"
4. Check: "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
5. Click "Save"

STEP 3: Test the System
------------------------
1. Open /test-admin-entry.html
2. Click "Submit Test Entry"
3. Check GitHub for new PR
4. Watch Actions tab for workflow execution

The workflows are already configured to use secrets.PAT_TIMELINE_BOT

If you need a PAT with workflow scope:
- Create new token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
- Select scopes: repo + workflow
- Use that token in the secret instead
