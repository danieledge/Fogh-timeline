  "title": "The Great North Wood",
  "description": "The Great North Wood gave Norwood its name and was a vast oak woodland from the 11th to 19th century covering the sides of what is now Crystal Palace ridge, including Gipsy Hill. Coppiced for charcoal burning—a major local industry with figures like 'Grimme the Collier of Croydon' becoming part of 16th-century popular culture—the wood provided essential resources for pre-industrial Surrey and Kent. Its oaks formed the timbers of Royal Navy vessels including Sir Francis Drake's Golden Hind, while oak bark supplied the leather tanning trade. The Archbishop of Canterbury and other Lords of the Manor held hunting rights and controlled timber felling, while commoners grazed animals on acorns and roots. The Domesday Book (1085) records the Archbishop's rights for 'hunting, fuel and pannage for 200 swine.' The dense woodland also sheltered outlaws and smugglers, creating a landscape both productive and mysterious that would define the area until 19th-century clearances.",
