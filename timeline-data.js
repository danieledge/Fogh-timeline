It provided crucial resources: timber for shipbuilding (notably the Royal Navy), oak bark for leather tanning, and charcoal for industries. Over centuries, commons within the wood formed a patchwork used by woodcutters, charcoal burners, and seasonal Romani camps. The slow clearance of this forest set the stage for all later settlement and development.<sup>93,94</sup>",
