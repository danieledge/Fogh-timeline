"description": "The Great North Wood gave Norwood its name and was a vast oak woodland from the 11th to 19th century covering the sides of what is now Crystal Palace ridge, including Gipsy Hill. Coppiced for charcoal burning—a major local industry with figures like 'Grimme the Collier of Croydon' becoming part of 16th-century popular culture—the wood provided essential resources for pre-industrial Surrey and Kent. Its oaks formed the timbers of Royal Navy vessels including Sir Francis Drake's Golden Hind, while oak bark supplied the leather tanning trade. The Archbishop of Canterbury and other Lords of the Manor held hunting rights and controlled timber felling, while commoners grazed animals on acorns and roots. The Domesday Book (1085) records the Archbishop's rights for 'hunting, fuel and pannage for 200 swine.' The dense woodland also sheltered outlaws and smugglers, creating a landscape both productive and mysterious that would define the area until 19th-century clearances.",

"description": "At the summit of Crystal Palace ridge stood the Vicar's Oak—a celebrated ancient tree where four parishes (Lambeth, Camberwell, Battersea, Streatham) met. This was near what is now the top of Westow Hill and Anerley Hill junction with Crystal Palace Parade. The spot was central to the community's 'beating the bounds' ceremonies, recorded in parish accounts since at least 1583, with mentions of gatherings and refreshments after circuit walks. This ancient tradition, dating from Anglo-Saxon times, involved parishioners walking their boundaries annually on Rogation Days before Ascension, often striking boundary markers with willow wands while boys were bumped against trees or turned upside-down to help them remember locations. Parish officials would read the Gospel at key points, reinforcing both spiritual and civic authority. The Vicar's Oak served as a lasting symbol of local unity and boundaries before modern borough divisions, with its hilltop location offering commanding views across the wooded landscape. The painting shows nearby Fox Hill in Upper Norwood, capturing the rural character of the area.",

After travelling over various parts of the Kingdom during the greater part of the 17th century, she settled at Norwood in her \"Gipsy House\" (believed to be near Oaks Avenue/Gipsy Hill SE19), where she lived for about 11 years. With her fame as a fortune-teller, she attracted numerous visitors and notoriety from London. She became known for her habit of sitting on the ground with her chin resting on her knees, often smoking two pipes and accompanied by her faithful dogs.",

His wife likely consulted Margaret Finch, who had become a renowned fortune teller. Later, Lord Byron, then at school with Dr. Glennie in Lordship Lane in Dulwich, whenever he felt inclined to play truant visited the Norwood Gypsies. These accounts illuminate how visiting gypsies for fortune-telling served as fashionable entertainment for London's social elite and captured the imagination of literary figures, providing some of the earliest documented references to the Romani presence in what would become Gipsy Hill.",

Living in a conical hut built of branches at the base of a tree, she became famous for sitting in a crouching position with her chin on her knees, smoking two pipes and accompanied by her faithful dogs. Her decades-long practice of sitting with her chin on her knees caused her sinews to become so contracted that she could not rise from that posture, requiring burial in a specially constructed deep square box. She was buried at St. George's Church, Beckenham with much pomp, attended by large crowds, mourning coaches, and 'a great concourse of people.'

Her love of cinema began at the nearby Crystal Palace cinema, where she watched silent films.

The Dulwich Estate gave the land to Camberwell at no cost, with the Council responsible for all paving charges, legal costs, surveyors' fees, and fence reconstruction. A deed dedicating land for use as a 'bus draw-in and shelter' was signed in November 1960. The site now belongs to Southwark, which incorporated Camberwell in 1965. Historic postcards show horse-drawn buses ran this route from around 1900, likely owned by Thomas Tilling bus company who had stables in Gipsy Road. In 1908, the route was allocated number 3, running between Brixton and South Croydon, later extended to Oxford Circus. The Dulwich Society secured funding in 2005 and 2015 to repair the shelter, and by popular demand it became Locally Listed in Southwark in 2023.",
